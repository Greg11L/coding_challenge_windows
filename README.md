Welcome to the Windows coding challenge. There are two challenges in this repo. 

The first is called TestApplication.cpp. This challenge will require you to create your own VS solution and then add this cpp file to it. Once you have your VS solution created, read the instrctions at the top of TestApplication.cpp to see what to do next.

The second is called FirdFirstChallengeNotification. This challenge comes with a VS solution already setup. The instructions for this challenge can be found in FirstFindChangeNotificaiton\Readme.txt.
